## Project Overview

The **[App Title]** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [Course Name] subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to [briefly describe the purpose of the app, e.g., provide a task management system, display weather forecasts, etc.].

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to [explain the app’s functionality]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: [Description of a feature, e.g., "User login functionality"]
- Feature 2: [Description of another feature, e.g., "Displaying weather data based on location"]
- Feature 3: [Optional, another feature, e.g., "Push notifications for reminders"]

These features aim to provide [what the app aims to achieve, e.g., an easy-to-use platform for managing tasks or organizing personal information].

## Design Considerations

The design of the **[App Title]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
